# Guideline for Lab Reports
- The report should be a single document file covering the complete exercise
- Use the cover sheet report template provided by in Moodle
- Use proper paper geometry, e.g., margins: right, left, top 2.5 cm, bottom 2 cm.
- Font size 11-12, line spacing between 1.15 and 1.5.

## Goal of the report:
- The report summarizes and presents your work on the exercises and answers all given questions from the task sheets
- In a step by step procedure, the report introduces the task, raises the questions, shows the solutions (including necessary intermediate results) and makes conclusions
- Readers (e.g., other students, supervisors and the professor) who have not attended the course and do not know about any implementations must be able to understand the report

## In the report
- Use meaningful heading for different sections (headings should be numbered and larger than the text, not bold and not underlined)
- Use table of contents (and list of figures)
- Number the pages
- When answering the questions, number and repeat the questions before providing answers below each corresponding question
- **When presenting a plot or a figure**
	- Carefully decide, what you intend to show/highlight/demonstrate with the figure
	- Introduce the figure with direct referencing in the text (e.g., Figure 1 shows ‚Ä¶) 
	- Center the figure horizontally
	- Label the figure
	- Label the axes (description and unit), appropriate font size
	- Use a grid if necessary
	- Use multiple colors or types for different lines within a plot
	- Use a legend if necessary
	- Describe plots and figures in detail, especially focus on the signal characteristics
	- Provide explanations for your plot descriptions
	- Make conclusions from the plot
- Figures and tables should be upright if possible, so that the reader does not need to rotate the page
- Use appropriate file formats for figures (e.g. latex: eps, pdf, svg; word: emf, wmf, svg, (large scaled png)) 
- **When presenting a formula/equation**
	- Use proper visualization, e.g., in MS Word use the equation editor (insert -> equation) or use the LaTeX equation option
	- Center equations horizontally
	- Number the equation
	- Use only symbols in equations and no written words
	- Explain all used symbols in the text after the equation. The symbols should have the same font and should not look different (compare: ùõΩ and Œ≤).
- Check for grammar and spelling mistakes before submission
